# Pattern Programs (Star & Number Patterns)

This repository contains **basic to intermediate pattern programs** using **numbers and stars**. These patterns are very common in **programming interviews**, **logic building**, and for **beginners learning loops** (for, while, do-while).

The patterns shown below are based on the reference image and are numbered **1 to 16**.

## 📌 Concepts Used

- `for` loops (nested loops)
- Numbers & sequences
- Incrementing / decrementing logic
- Space handling
- Basic pattern symmetry
